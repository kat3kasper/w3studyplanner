# StudyPlanner

StudyPlanner is a web application that allows advisors and students streamline the process of filling out a study plan by reducing the rate of errors. It allows students to construct and organize their study plan and ensures that their choice of courses and courseload satisfies their degree requirements and target graduation date. Advisors and administrators can also create and modify degree requirements as needed to have an up-to-date curriculum. 

The web application uses a constraint solver developed using the ECLiPSe constraint logic programming system.
